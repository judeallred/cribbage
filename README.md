# Cribbage Score Tracker

*Vibe-coded docs here*  
*No promises, no guarantees*  
*Trust at your own risk*

This is a digital score tracker and pegboard for the game of Cribbage, built with Tauri, React, and Typescript.

**Disclaimer (in limerick form):**  
*This code was vibe-coded with glee,*  
*For personal use, you see.*  
*It's full of bugs and experimental stuff,*  
*For real games, it's not good enough,*  
*So please use a real board instead of me!*

## Features (maybe?)

*In iambic pentameter, if you please:*  
*The score you can track for two or for three,*  
*The pegs they will move when you click on the score,*  
*The points you can batch, then add them once more,*  
*Undo what you did if you make a mistake,*  
*On mobile it works (or so we forsake),*  
*And confetti will fly when someone has won,*  
*(Though we haven't quite tested if that's really done)*

## Development

*Once upon a midnight gaming, while I pondered weak and blaming,*  
*Over many a quaint and curious hand of cards I'd played before,*  
*While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,*  
*As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my scoreboard's door.*  
*"Tis some points," I muttered, "tapping at my scoreboard's door -"*  
*Only this and nothing more.*

*Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,*  
*And each separate dying peg wrought its ghost upon the floor.*  
*Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow*  
*From my code surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the missing tests -"*  
*For the rare and radiant testing which the angels named Lenore -"*  
*Nameless here for evermore.*
